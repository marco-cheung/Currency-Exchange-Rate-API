Under the Linked Exchange Rate system (LERS), the Hong Kong Dollar has been pegged to a narrow trading band between HK$7.75 and HK$7.85 per US dollar. When the Hong Kong currency hits the low end of the band, say 7.85, the cityâ€™s de-facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, is bound to start buying up the currency to ensure that the USD/HKD exchange rate will not fall below the weak-side Convertibility Undertaking.

A weaker yuan exchange rate implies that Chinese products would be cheaper in terms of US dollars, maintaining their competitiveness in the market despite a new round of punitive tariffs imposed by the United States.
